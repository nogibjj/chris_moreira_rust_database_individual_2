# Project Purpose
This project explores the performance of Rust in handling data extraction, transformation, and database operations using SQLite. The dataset, sourced from GitHub, is processed in Rust to create and populate a SQLite database, where CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are performed. The aim is to evaluate Rust's efficiency and suitability for data-heavy applications, particularly when handling structured datasets in a database. By focusing solely on Rust, this project demonstrates how it can effectively replace traditional scripting languages for data processing and database management, leveraging its speed and safety features.

Some operations we run with rust to sucessfully complete the project
```bash

#Build the project
cargo build

# Run the project
cargo run

# Make A new project
cargo new __project_name__

#Checking Dependencies
cargo check

#Adding Dependencies
cargo add dependency --features dependency_feature
cargo add dependency

```
